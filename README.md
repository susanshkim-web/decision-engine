# Decision Engine

**"Permission to let unimportant things disappear"**

A ruthless thought capture and prioritization tool built for execution, not hoarding.

## The Commitment

**I will open this app once daily for 14 days.**

If I don't, I'll delete it and use paper instead.

## Core Principles

1. **Max 10 items per category** - Full means something has to go
2. **Capture to clear, not defer** - Every thought must be categorized or deleted
3. **No infinite scroll** - If it doesn't fit on one screen, you have too much
4. **Deletion is a feature** - Most thoughts aren't worth keeping

## Categories

- **QUICK** - Fast actions (< 5 min)
- **WORK** - Professional tasks and projects
- **PERSONAL** - Life admin and personal goals

## How to Use

1. Open app
2. Tap **+ CAPTURE** when thoughts pile up
3. Brain dump everything (one thought per line)
4. Hit **PROCESS**
5. Swipe through each thought and categorize or delete
6. When you have time, open a category and execute

## Installation

### On Phone (iPhone/Android)
1. Open in Safari/Chrome
2. Tap share button
3. "Add to Home Screen"
4. Opens like a native app

### On Laptop
1. Open the deployed URL
2. Bookmark it or install as PWA (Chrome: Install App button)

## Tech

## License

Do whatever you want with this. The real value is in using it, not the code.
